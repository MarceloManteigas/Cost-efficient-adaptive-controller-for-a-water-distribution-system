# Cost-efficient-adaptive-controller-for-a-water-distribution-system

This programme presents an algorithm with a new methodology for controlling pump stations in the most adaptive and cost-efficient way. The algorithm simulates a water distribution network at the same time it makes the control. This project was developed for my thesis.
